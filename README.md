while learning git... 

Started with a [Learn Enough to Be Dangerous (Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous] (https://www.learnenough.com/git) by Michael Hartl.
It is a soft introduction with hands-on exercises and tips.

Could not remember the commands despite the workflow was pretty clear to me. This is where a [Git Visualiser] (http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) came in. Interactive picture speaks a thousand word.
