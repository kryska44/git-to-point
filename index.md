what I have found helpful when learning Git:

I used Michael Hartl's soft introduction: [Learn Enough To Be Dangerous] (https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial/getting_started). This is a really soft introduction to the basic workflow anyone who want to learn programming would need. It is hands-on approach with good tips and confidence building. I have covered Micahel`s tutorials on basic command line and editor so I felt encouraged to try and check [git man pages] (https://helpmanual.io/man1/git/).


[Git Visualiser](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) - I had problem memorizing commands despite the logic of the workflow was fairly easy at the start.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kryska44/website/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kryska44/website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
